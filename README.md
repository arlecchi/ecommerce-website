# MerchVerse e-commerce website

An eâ€‘commerce website project developed for Workshop on Implementation of Software Design.

This application allows users to browse, search, and order merchandise products online. Customers can view search products, product details, add items to a wishlist or shopping cart, and complete purchases with manual payment confirmation. Administrators can manage products, validate payments, and handle order fulfillment.

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Manual Setup

1. **Start the Backend (API)**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   node app.js
   ```
2. **Start the Frontend (React)**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start  
   ```
### Option 2: Docker Setup
1. From the repository root:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This command will:

   Build the backend image using Dockerfile.backend

   Build the frontend image using Dockerfile.frontend

   Start both services and expose:

       Backend on port 3200

       Frontend on port 3000
2. To stop and remove containers:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start  
   ```

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- Built using **React** (Create React App)
- **Context API** for global state management (e.g., user data, products, cart)
- **Axios** for making HTTP requests to the backend
- Component structure separates pages, layouts, and reusable UI elements
- Handles routing with **React Router**

### Backend
- **Serverless architecture** using Node.js functions
- Acts as a REST API to serve product data and manage transactions
- Deployed as part of the fullstack app (e.g., through Vercel functions or equivalent)

### Integration
- Frontend consumes the API via Axios calls (e.g., in `MyContext.js`)
- All product-related functionality (view, cart, purchase) is dynamically fetched
- Backend runs on port `3200` during development and integrates seamlessly in production

### DevOps
- Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend located at project root
- `docker-compose.yml` to build and run containers
- Supports local development as well as containerized deployment
